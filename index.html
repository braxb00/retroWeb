            <p>Sillybandz are the creation of serial entrepreneur Robert Croak. First launched in 2009, Sillybandz became a worldwide phenomenon in 2010 and went on to be one of the biggest trends in history, compared to the likes of the Slinky and Kabbage Patch Dolls. Fast forward to 2020 and Sillybandz are once again gaining popularity and starting to be embraced by kids, teens, and Influencers.</p>

          <div class="text-box-2">
            <p><br><br>Before the creation of Sillybandz, the word “silicone” mustered up ideas of breast augmen-tations or an industrial rubber-like substance. Society knew silicone as raw material in caulk, medicine, electrical insulation, and maybe even makeup filler; but certainly not as a fashion accessory. Thanks to Robert Croak popularizing silicone jewelry with his global phenomenon of Sillybandz in 2009, silicone became the world’s most popular bracelet, and now there are over a billion of them around the globe.<br><br>
            Sillybandz fans always want to know how Robert came up with his multi-million-dollar idea. It all began when he visited a product show in China where he was presented a very-poorly-shaped animal rubber band by a Japanese designer. Robert looked at the oddly shaped rubber band in his hand and tried to see how the vague outline was actually intended to look like a dog. The Jap-anese seller told Robert his rubber bands were to be sold as an office supply product. Although Robert felt that it would never sell as a novelty rubber band for adults, this very moment was the match that lit the fire of an incredible idea.</p>

          <div class="text-box-3">
              <p>With wild entrepreneur instinct, Robert took the product back to his office in Toledo, Ohio and pitched the idea of making them into silicone children’s bracelets, adding artistic detail, and calling them Sillybandz. The staff didn’t believe in it and didn’t think customers would invest in “silly silicone bracelets,” but Robert forged ahead with design and manufacturing. Many people assume Sillybandz was an instant hit, but that is far from the truth. Robert recalls, “It was a very slow build. With some key stores like Learning Express onboard, it slowly grew to a tipping point. But to this day, my mantra is ‘Always go with your gut,’ and I am so glad I did!” Not long after fortunate celebrity interactions, like Sarah Jessica Parker and Shakira wearing the bracelets, the Sillybandz brand grew momentum. Little did Robert know, his little idea was about to be the biggest bracelet trend the world had ever seen.</p>
